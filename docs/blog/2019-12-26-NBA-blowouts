    <h1>Is it just me, or have there been a lot of 40-point blowouts in the NBA this season?</h1>

<div class="content">
    <p>I had a hunch that this year there have been more 40-point blowouts compared to the previous years. To look in to the data, I pulled game data from <a href="https://basketball-reference.com">basketball-reference.com</a>.</p>

<p><img src="/static/images/12-26-19_1.png" alt="Chart of 40-point blowouts in the last 6 seasons" title="Chart of 40-point blowouts in the last 6 seasons" /></p>

<p>In the last 5 seasons, there had been between 5-10 blowouts by 40 points. So far in this season, there had been 8 40-point blowouts, and if they continue at the current rate we would end with 21.</p>

<p>Next I wanted to look at how many 20, 30 and 40-point blowouts there were each season in the last few seasons.</p>

<p><img src="/static/images/12-26-19_2.png" alt="Chart of 20, 30 and 40-point blowouts in the last 6 seasons" title="Chart of 20, 30 and 40-point blowouts in the last 6 seasons" /></p>

<p>Using the current season to project the rate of blowouts, there would be about the same amount of 20 and 30-point blowouts as the last 5 years, but more than twice as many 40-point blowouts.</p>

<p>So what does the distribution of blowouts throughout the season look like? First I graphed 30-point blowouts.</p>

<p><img src="/static/images/12-26-19_3.png" alt="Distribution of 30-point blowouts in the last 5 seasons" title="Distribution of 30-point blowouts in the last 5 seasons" /></p>

<p>30-point blowouts are pretty evenly distributed, so this doesn't really tell us much.</p>

<p>I'm more interested in the distribution of 40-point blowouts.</p>

<p><img src="/static/images/12-26-19_4.png" alt="Distribution of 40-point blowouts in the last 5 seasons" title="Distribution of 40-point blowouts in the last 5 seasons" /></p>

<p>I had some ideas why there would be more 40-point blowouts later or earlier in the season. It could be that good teams win by 40 in the beginning of the year to make a statement, or bad teams lose by 40 at the end of the year because they've given up.</p>

<p>Either way, I wanted to find the projected rate of 40-point blowouts this season using the percent of blowouts in the past seasons at the current game mark. Basically, if this season's 'blowout rate' was the same as a past season's 'blowout rate', how many blowouts will this season have?</p>

<p><img src="/static/images/12-26-19_5.png" alt="Projected 40-point blowouts this season using data from last 5 seasons" title="Projected 40-point blowouts this season using data from last 5 seasons" /></p>

<p>Using the last 5 NBA seasons as a guide, we can expect the total number of 40-point blowouts this season to be between 18-21. This would be the most blowouts for a single season in the NBA since the ABA-NBA merger in 1976.</p>
